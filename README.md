Project Title: block05 
Problem: Coding the The Zoo Problem in HTML and CSS only
What I learned in HTML: how to insert an image, write a good "alt" description for accessibility purposes, and link an external wesbite for more information.
What I learned in CSS: how to insert a background; how to add a box shadow to give more perspective to the cards; how to create a border-radius to make an image placed in a circle; add a hover with a color change.
What did not work: The Bear cards did not adopt all of the styling for .card- the gap is incorrect and the colors are not follwoing suite.
I hope top continue to build the sight, fix the styling for the Bear cards, and add more buttons and possibly a better background. I was looking for a more jungle style background that I could add the opacity value to so it was not so dark and overwhelming.
